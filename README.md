Intellij was being retarded, so I tried to drag-drop the mdk but it was "too many files" so I just added the src. Also idk how github works :D.

# Concept:

To start with, I don't have a complete idea for what the mod is, I'm figuring literally everything out as I go, and everything is subject to change.  
What I am sure of is the combat portion the mod adds, which splits into two halfs; Powers and Artifacts.

# Powers:

The player is granted a random power upon first joining a world, the effect/abilities of these powers vary greatly. While only 2 have been made, I have a list of ideas while keeping the tier system in mind.  
The strength of a power compared to another can vary drastically, to put into perspective, I've made a tier system (that has no actual function, just to help categorize).  
The idea is that each power will be useful and (hopefully) satisfying to use, even if niche or weak.

S+:
The absolute strongest powers, players with these will be borderline unbeatable. However, these powers will have a specific weakness in the form of Cursed Artifacts.

S:
Strong powers. These will have incredible amounts of strengh and/or range of use.

A:
Above average. Powerful in combat and/or have wide range of use.

B:
Average powers. These have solid applications and strengths.

C:
Considered below average. While not too far from B tier, they are generally weaker.

D:
These have niche abilities or are just underwhelming.



Two powers that have been made are:

Boost, a B tier power that grants the player a passive health, armor, toughness, strength, attack speed, and movement speed increase. Values are subject to change do to balancing.

Vitality, a C tier power that greatly increases the players max health. Again, subject to change due to balancing.


# Eclipse:

With a large list of powers, it is very likely the player will receive one that is weaker than they'd like, one they don't like at all, or they may be wanting a specific one. This is where the Eclipse comes in.  
While I have not decided the specifics, the current idea is that every X days, if the player has a certain (and rare) item, they will be able to use it to participate in the Eclipse. The Eclipse will consume said item and in turn grant the player a new random power.  
I'm aware of how this could be a very annoying mechanic, so again, I have not decided on this yet. (It's also inspired by (more like copied from :D ) Berserk)



# Artifacts:

Artifacts are the other half of the combat the mod will add. They act as a more obtainable and customizable counterpart to powers, and come in the form of weapons, tools, and armor.
The method of obtainment is currently undetermined, and they come in two types with another tier system to categorize them by strength.  

Standalone: Standalone artifacts have an innate ability or trait, either a passive effect or a single usable ability.  
An example of this is the Katana of Wind, a Rare, rather weak sword. It has infinite durability and can shoot damaging projectiles on command.
  
Imbue/Enhancement: Imbue artifacts can be imbued with the players power, either upgrading it's ability or extending it by imbuing it into the artifact.  
While none have been made, the idea is for this to bridge the gap between the weaker powers and the stronger ones, or provide new abilities to the ones that are rather straightforward.  
Here is a concept for both a power, Gills, and an artifact, Leviathan Helmet. Gills, a D tier power that simply provides you with infinite oxygen, preventing drowning. When imbued into the Legendary Leviathan Helmet, the power is enhanced, allowing you to control (give/take) the oxygen from entities around you. This effectivey turns a weak and niche D tier power to what I would consider an A or B tier.
  
Artifact Tiers (This will likely be for determining rarity):

Cursed:
Cursed artifacts are unique, exclusively of the standalone type. They posses a specific ability used to counter the overwhelming strength of S+ tier powers.

Mythical:
The strongest, also exclusively of the standalone type, they posses a very powerful ability.

Legendary:
Strong, powerful enough to fight against even above average powers on their own, or greatly enhance the players power.

Rare:
Above average, these possess a solid ability or enhancement.

Uncommon:
Average, these possess an average ability or enhancement.

Common:

The weakest tier, they will have a niche ability or enhancement.
